## Description
This is an app that allows users to keep track of their spending whether they are online or offline.

## Scenario
The majority of the code was delivered to me as a homework assignment in the University of Pennsylvania's/Trilogy Education's Computer Coding Bootcamp. Our task was to give the app functionality in offline mode. To that end, I worked on adding a service-worker file and a manifest file. 

## Dependencies

This app relies on Express, Compression, Mongoose, and Morgan.
